===============================

Simple arcade game made as an exercise for Udacity Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree Program. The base code and resources for the exercise are from
here: https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

To run simply dowload the files and open index.html file with your favorite
browser. The game starts automatically.

You can move your character with arrow keys. Your objective is to move your
character up across the road and into the blue water on the other side of the
road without getting hit by the beetles running along the road. Good luck!
